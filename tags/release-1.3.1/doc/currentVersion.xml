		This is the file that gets queried by the update checker.
		It must be updated only when all release procedures have been
		completed and the released version has been tested throughly.
		
		It must contain 3 elements.
		
		- currentVersion : 
			The version id of the latest release.
		
		- downloadUrl : 
			a URL to open if the user wishes to update.
		
		- releaseNotes : 
			a HTML formatted text which contains the release notes of the current
			version. Be aware that you need to explicitly define line wraps or else
			the resulting JLabel will be super wide.
