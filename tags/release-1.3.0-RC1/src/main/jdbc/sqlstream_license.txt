You must include a provision specifying us as a third party beneficiary of the agreement.  You are responsible for obtaining these agreements with your end users.

You agree that U.S. export control laws and other applicable export and import laws govern your use of the programs, including technical data.  You agree that neither the programs nor any direct product thereof will be exported, directly, or indirectly, in violation of these laws, or will be used for any purpose prohibited by these laws including, without limitation, nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons proliferation.

Disclaimer of Warranty and Exclusive Remedies

THE PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.  WE FURTHER DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS AND IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGEMENT.

IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA OR DATA USE, INCURRED BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT OR TORT, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  OUR ENTIRE LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES HEREUNDER SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS (U.S. $1,000).

No Technical Support
This agreement does not grant you the right to receive technical support.  Our technical support organization is not obligated in any way to provide technical support, phone support, or updates to you for the programs licensed under this agreement. 

End of Agreement
We have the right to terminate your right to use the programs if you fail to comply with any of the terms of this agreement, in which case you shall destroy all copies of the programs.

Relationship Between the Parties
The relationship between you and us is that of licensee/licensor.  Neither party will represent that it has any authority to assume or create any obligation, express or implied, on behalf of the other party, nor to represent the other party as agent, employee, franchisee, or in any other capacity.  Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to limit either party's right to independently develop or distribute software that is functionally similar to the other party's products, so long as proprietary information of the other party is not included in such software.

Open Source
"Open Source" software - software available without charge for use, modification and distribution - is often licensed under terms that require the user to make the user's modifications to the Open Source software or any software that the user 'combines' with the Open Source software freely available in source code form.  If you use Open Source software in conjunction with the programs, you must ensure that your use does not:  (i) create, or purport to create, obligations of us with respect to the SQLstream programs; or (ii) grant, or purport to grant, to any third party any rights to or immunities under our intellectual property or proprietary rights in the SQLstream programs.  For example, you may not develop a software program using an SQLstream program and an Open Source program where such use results in a program file(s) that contains code from both the SQLstream program and the Open Source program (including without limitation libraries) if the Open Source program is licensed under a license that requires any "modifications" be made freely available.  You also may not combine the SQLstream program with programs licensed under the GNU General Public License or other similar open source license ("GPL") in any manner that could cause, or could be interpreted or asserted to cause, the SQLstream program or any modifications thereto to become subject to the terms of the GPL.

Entire Agreement
You agree that this agreement is the complete agreement for the programs and licenses, and this agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations.  If any term of this agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain effective.
