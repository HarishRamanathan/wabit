IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING JDBC DRIVERS AND THE SYSTEM CLASSPATH

The JDBC drivers must not be on the system classpath. They are treated
as resources rather than libraries.

Illustrative example:

If xyz_driver.jar is a JDBC driver that contains class "com.xyz.Driver",
the following statements must hold:

Class.forName("com.xyz.Driver") must throw a NoClassDefFoundException

ClassLoader.getSystemResource("xyz_driver.jar") must return a valid URL
to the contents of the xyz_driver.jar file.

For lots more information on the reason why, consult the javadoc
documentation of the following:

class ca.sqlpower.sql.JDBCDataSourceType
class ca.sqlpower.sql.JDBCDataSourceType.JDBCClassLoader
method ca.sqlpower.sql.JDBCDataSource.jarSpecToFile()
