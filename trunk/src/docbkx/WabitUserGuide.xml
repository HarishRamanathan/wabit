			<title>About Wabit</title>

			<para>
				Wabit from SQL Power Group is a reporting tool 
				designed for anyone who needs to make reports
				simply and easily. Each major part of Wabit has
				an easy drag and drop interface that allows
				users to piece together many kinds of queries
				and reports. These queries and reports can
				then be exported for use in other projects
				or printed.

        <title>The Project Page</title>
        
        <para>
            The project page is the starting point of Wabit.
            All projects need at least one data source added 
            to the project to create queries on. To add a data
            source to the current project select a data source
            from the list and press the <guibutton>Start</guibutton>
            button. Currently only databases can be added as
            data sources to Wabit. For more information on creating
            a database connection see <xref linkend="setup_database" />.
            Once a data source has been added to the project queries
            can be made on the project from the query builder.

       <title>Setting up a Data Source</title>
       
       <para>
           Before creating queries in Wabit a data source needs
           to be added to the project to tell the queries where
           the data is coming from. Wabit allows you to use any 
           JDBC- or ODBC-accessible database as a data source.

                platforms you plan to work with (such as SQL Server,
                MySQL, Oracle, DB2, etc.). These settings will be used

                                                When you create a

                                                Wabit will use
                                                this template to create
                                                the connection URL. In
                                                this example, the
                                                template will create the
                                                URL
                                                "jdbc:sqlserver://:1433",
                                                where 1433 is the
                                                default port value.
                                                Since SQL Server
                                                databases listen to port
                                                1433 by default, it
                                                makes sense to include
                                                this value in the
                                                template. When you're
                                                creating the actual
                                                database connection, you
                                                can change the port
                                                value if the database
                                                you're connecting to is
                                                configured differently.

                    Whether you are adding a new database platform to
                    Wabit or want to use one of the
                    pre-configured platforms, the last step in setting
                    up a database type is to locate the JAR file (or
                    files) that contain the JDBC drivers for the
                    database platform.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Note: Remember, at this point you are just telling
                    Wabit where the drivers are. You must set
                    up a database connection in order to connect to a
                    specific database server (for more information, see
                    <xref linkend="setup_database.connections" />
                    ).
                </para>

                <para>
                    Unlike most applications, which need a distinct
                    driver program to communicate with each type of
                    database, Wabit uses Java-based drivers.
                    These drivers normally come from the database vendor
                    in the form of JAR (Java Archive) files. JAR files
                    are an extension to the file format used by
                    PKZip/WinZip archives.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Most database platforms provide drivers that are
                    fully backward compatible. This means that it is
                    best to use the newest driver available, regardless
                    of the software version on the specific database
                    server you intend to connect to. One exception to
                    this is the Oracle database. It is important to
                    match the major version number of your JDBC driver
                    with the major version number of the Oracle database
                    server you connect to. For example, if you are
                    connecting to an Oracle 10g database, use the latest
                    Oracle 10g driver. If you are connecting to an
                    Oracle 9i database, use the Oracle 9i driver.

            The query builder allows users to design queries
            through a graphical or textual interface. The
            query builder has four main sections: the query
            pen, the text editor, the database tree, and the
            results tab.

                The query pen allows creating queries by dragging
                and dropping tables from the database tree on the
                right to the query pen. When a table is dropped into
                the query pen it will be populated with all of its
                columns and a join will be created for each existing
                relationship between the dropped table and any table
                currently in the query pen.

                    The table can be given an alias by clicking on
                    the table name and changing it. To remove the table
                    alias set the alias back to the table's original
                    name or remove the alias text while editing it.

                    Columns in the table are added to the query if they
                    have a check beside their name. Columns are easily
                    added and removed by changing the check box. All the
                    columns in a table can be turn on and off at the same

                    the table header.

                    For example if we want all movies with a rating above
                    8.0 adding the text <quote>&gt; 8.0</quote> to the right
                    of the <quote>rating</quote> column.

                Joins can be created between two columns in the query
                pen by selecting the join button and clicking on two
                columns in different tables. The type of join created
                between the two columns defaults to an inner join equating
                the columns. To change how the join relates the two columns
                right click on the middle node in the join to see all
                available options to use to join the columns on. To
                change the join from an inner join right click near the
                join line on the side that is to be changed to get a 
                menu. From this menu the join can be changed to an outer
                join on that side. If a full outer join is desired both
                sides of the join can be changed to outer join.

                With the tables in the query pen is a constants table.
                This table can have additional columns defined that
                are constants, functions, or modified columns in the
                existing tables. To add a constant to a query click
                the <quote>Add...</quote> field at the bottom of the
                table. This will allow the constant to be typed in.
                When the constant is complete it will be added to the
                constants table. To modify the constant at any time
                just click on it. Constants can be added and removed
                from a query, and given a where clause the same as columns
                in a table. To add an alias to a column click in the
                alias field to the right of the column. If functions
                are needed on the graphical query builder they can be
                placed in the constants table even if they require columns.
                The only restriction on adding functions depending on 
                columns is the tables containing those columns must
                be in the query, even if nothing is selected from them.

                Once a query is complete a report layout can be created
                from a template using the query from the report button.
                Additionally, the query can be exported as text to a file
                or the query and its associated data source can be exported
                to a new Wabit file. Exporting a single query allows others
                to import that query into their project for other uses.

                The sort order of each column is defined by an arrow pointing
                up for ascending sort and down for descending sort. Clicking
                on the header of a column will change the sort order to ascending,
                then descending, then back to the default removing the sort order.
                To sort multiple columns at once shift can be held down and the columns
                can be sorted starting at the first column to sort and finishing
                at the last column to sort.

                The text editor in the query builder will allow any free formed SQL
                statement to be executed. If changes were made to the graphical

                the graphical builder. If the text of the query is modified then
                the graphical editor will not be accessible unless the changes
                to the text are discarded. In later releases it may be possible to
                go freely between the graphical and textual editors. Queries created
                or modified in the text editor can also be exported and have report

            The report layout allows users to create and alter the look of 
            a report. Reports can have any number of queries, guides, text
            containers, and image containers on them. Once created, these
            components can be dragged around the layout as desired. When printed or exported, the 
            report layout created will be repeated until all of the result
            sets added to the report have exported all of their values.

            resized as desired. To change the text in the text box double 
            click it to bring up its editor. The text editor allows changing
            the text as well as changing the font, alignment and background colour.

            Horizontal and vertical guides are useful in organizing
            a report. Each report starts with two horizontal and
            vertical guides to define the margins of the page. To
            create a new guide click the horizontal or vertical
            guide button and then click on the report for the guide's
            initial position. Once placed the guide can be dragged
            left and right, if it is a vertical guide, or up and
            down, if it is a horizontal guide. When a guide meets a 
            content box of any kind, including a query, the content
            box will snap to the guide and move with it until the 
            content box is moved off of the guide.

		    The first step in creating a report in Wabit is adding a connection to the 
            data source where your data is saved. Connections are added to Wabit from 
            the project page which can be reached by clicking the project folder at the 
            top of the project tree on the left.

            source's type will partially populate the JDBC URL. If additional information
            is needed for the URL they will be able to be set from the connection options.
			After the JDBC URL is specified the data source's user name and password need
			to be set, and a name needs to be given to the connection. Once the data source
			is specified the connection can be tested with the "Test Connection" button.
			If there are any problems with the JDBC driver refer to the JDBC drivers section

			<para>
			The query builder allows users to easily 
			put together queries by dragging and dropping tables into the query pen.
			The following example is based off the demo database included with Wabit.
		    </para>
		    
		    <para>
		    Lets say we want to create a query to get the names of all the action movie actors.
			Lets first rename the query to "Action movie actors" to remember what the query is
			for. Renaming a query is done simply by double clicking the query in the project tree.
			To start making the query tables will need to be brought in from the database. On the database
			tree on the right of the tool expand the Demo project database and then expand the
			Public catalog. Under the Public catalog is a list of all of the tables in the database.
			The first table needed is the Actor table. The table can be added to the query by dragging
			it from the tree to the query pen. The next table needed is the Movie table to know
			which movies are action moves. The last table for the query is the Cast_and_crew table
			which will join the Actor table to the Movie table. When the Cast_and_crew table is
			dropped in the query pen it will automatically create a join for each relationship
			in the database. Now that the query has several tables the results at the bottom of
			the screen will have a table populated with some of the values from the database. The
			results will be updated each time the query is modified. Next we need to remove columns
			from the result that we don't need. Since we only want the names of the actors we
			can remove all of the columns in both the Movie and Cast_and_crew tables. This is done
			quickly by un-checking the top check box in each table. The actor_id and dob are also not
			needed so they can be un-checked as well. To find the actors that played in action movies
			a where clause will be needed on the genre of the movie. To add a where clause click
			in the where column to the right of the genre field in the movie table. As only movies
			with the genre "Action" are desired the field will need to contain "= 'Action'".
			Now in the results there should be a table with only two fields "last_name" and "first_name"
			with only actor names that played in action movies. Before moving to the report layout
			lets reorder the results, sort them, and modify their column names. To order the results
			simply click the header of a column, columns can be sorted in ascending or descending order. 
			If multiple columns are to be sorted hold Ctrl and click on the header of each column to
			sort starting from the first column to be sorted by and ending at the last. For the example
			we can sort the last name of the actors in ascending order by clicking on the header until
			the sort arrow points up. To reorder the columns in the result simply drag the column to the
			desired location in the result. Since the last name is the first column before the first name
			grab the last name column's header and drag it after the first name column in the result.
			Finally, to rename columns any column name can be clicked on in the query pen and changed. For
			the example we can change the last name from "last_name" to "surname" by clicking
			the column in the Actor table and changing the text to "surname". Now the column's name
			has changed. In the table in the query pen the column's original name is shown in brackets
			to the right of the alias for the column. Now that the query is complete we can move to
			laying out the report. To generate a report based on the query click the layout button
			to the right of the zoom slider at the top of the query pen.
			</para>

			<title>Laying Out a Report</title>
			
			<para>
			To add new report layouts to a project right click the project tree and select "New Layout".
			Layouts created from queries come from a template that adds a header and footer to the results
			of the query. While the report layout only shows one page, the layout of this page will be
			repeated for each page required to print or export the entire query results. The following 
			example is based off the layout generated from part 2.
			</para>
			
			<para>
			Now that the report layout has been created the layout can be modified before exporting or printing.
			The first thing to change from the default is the header. To modify the contents of any box in the 
			layout simply double click the box to show its properties window. The properties of any text box
			is a simple text editor with font and alignment choices. After giving the header of the report
			a new value press OK and the header on the report will change. Next the query results can be 
			modified by double clicking it. The font for the results can be changed as well as the background
			colour. The null string that can be specified will be what is displayed if any cell of the result
			returns a null value. Borders can also be specified from a list of available options. Finally,
			each column can be modified individually. For this report change the name of the first column to
			"First Name" and increase the space given to the first name column to spread out the results.
			To make the report look nicer add an image to it by pressing the image button in the tool bar and
			then clicking on the report. An image will have to be selected before the image appears on the report.
			To place the image in the report drag it to the desired location. If you drag the image near a guide,
			one of the dashed lines that make up the border, the image will snap to it. To remove a content
			box from a guide drag it away from the guide quickly. Guides can also be inserted into a report
			to help layout different components. Guides can be added by clicking on the horizontal or vertical
			guide button in the tool bar and then clicking on the report. Now that the report is finished it
			can be exported to a PDF file or printed from the tool bar.

                    by the terms of this License, including without
                    limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of

                    of this License or a future version of this License
                    released under Section 6.1, and You must include a

                    of this License either on the same media as an

                    particular Modification has been made available to
                    such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring
                    that the Source Code version remains available even

                    a file documenting the changes You made to create
                    that Covered Code and the date of any change. You

                    Modification is derived, directly or indirectly,
                    from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer
                    and including the name of the Initial Developer in

                    Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license
                    under a third party's intellectual property rights
                    is required to exercise the rights granted by such
                    Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor
                    must include a text file with the Source Code
                    distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the
                    claim and the party making the claim in sufficient
                    detail that a recipient will know whom to contact.
                    If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the
                    Modification is made available as described in
                    Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the
                    LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
                    thereafter and shall take other steps (such as
                    notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
                    reasonably calculated to inform those who received
                    the Covered Code that new knowledge has been
                    obtained.

                    are reasonably necessary to implement that API,

                    above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
                    Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s)
                    and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant

                    3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice
                    in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it
                    is not possible to put such notice in a particular
                    Source Code file due to its structure, then You must
                    include such notice in a location (such as a
                    relevant directory) where a user would be likely to
                    look for such a notice. If You created one or more
                    Modification(s) You may add your name as a
                    Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.
                    You must also duplicate this License in any
                    documentation for the Source Code where You describe
                    recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to
                    Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge
                    a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
                    obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
                    Code. However, You may do so only on Your own
                    behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer
                    or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
                    clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or
                    liability obligation is offered by You alone, and
                    You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
                    and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
                    the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
                    result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability
                    terms You offer.

                    3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may
                    distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if
                    the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met
                    for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice
                    stating that the Source Code version of the Covered
                    Code is available under the terms of this License,
                    including a description of how and where You have
                    fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice
                    must be conspicuously included in any notice in an
                    Executable version, related documentation or
                    collateral in which You describe recipients' rights
                    relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the
                    Executable version of Covered Code or ownership
                    rights under a license of Your choice, which may
                    contain terms different from this License, provided
                    that You are in compliance with the terms of this
                    License and that the license for the Executable
                    version does not attempt to limit or alter the
                    recipient's rights in the Source Code version from
                    the rights set forth in this License. If You
                    distribute the Executable version under a different
                    license You must make it absolutely clear that any
                    terms which differ from this License are offered by
                    You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
                    Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
                    Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
                    liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
                    Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

                    by the terms of this License and distribute the
                    Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You
                    must make sure the requirements of this License are

                    possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the

                    be included with all distributions of the Source
                    Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or
                    regulation, such description must be sufficiently

                    License, You may always continue to use it under the

                    such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent
                    version of the License published by Netscape. No one
                    other than Netscape has the right to modify the

                    This License represents the complete agreement
                    concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision
                    of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
                    provision shall be reformed only to the extent
                    necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall
                    be governed by California law provisions (except to
                    the extent applicable law, if any, provides
                    otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law
                    provisions. With respect to disputes in which at
                    least one party is a citizen of, or an entity
                    chartered or registered to do business in the United
                    States of America, any litigation relating to this
                    License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the
                    Federal Courts of the Northern District of
                    California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
                    California, with the losing party responsible for
                    costs, including without limitation, court costs and
                    reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
                    application of the United Nations Convention on
                    Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
                    expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which
                    provides that the language of a contract shall be
                    construed against the drafter shall not apply to
                    this License.
