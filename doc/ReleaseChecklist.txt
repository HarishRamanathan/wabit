                     Wabit release checklist

$Id: ReleaseChecklist.txt 2874 2008-12-12 20:19:05Z jeffrey@sqlpower.ca $

This file is intended as a guide for the person who is packaging, posting,
and announcing a new release of the Wabit.  This list is probably
not complete.  If you find yourself performing a step that is not mentioned
here, please add it!

The items listed here are intended to be in a sensible chronological order.
If working from top to bottom paints you into a corner, adjust the order so
that the next person won't run into the same problem.

Good luck with the release!


*Comment out all the logging configs set to DEBUG (leave the RootLogger at INFO)
*Update the wabit.properties file in src/main/resources and the pom.xml and in the src/main/installer/install.xml to reflect the correct
 release number.  Normally, this will mean setting the suffix to "" for a full
 release, or "beta", "rc1", etc for a pre-release.
*Update the doc/ReleaseNotes.txt file with the latest features and bugfixes.
*Run the LibraryMegaTest and Wabit tests. It should pass with a flying colour (green)
*Run 'mvn site' to generate the PDF and JavaHelp documentation, and the download page
*Read the formatted documentation, noting what's missing or incorrect. Then update
 the documentation. (This will need to be done when Wabit has documentation.)
*(Clover will be added later) Generate the JUnit and Clover test reports (run the 'clover.test.and.report' build.xml
 target). This must be done separately from 'dist', otherwise the executables generated will
 require the clover.jar library to run.
*Change the systemPath property in the pom.xml to absolute paths for the Maven dependencies in both sqlpower-library and wabit
*Run the 'Maven clean' target from the "Run as" menu on the POM to remove the Clover-dependent 
 compiled class files.
*Build the distribution by running the command "mvn assembly:assembly" from a terminal
 in the Wabit directory. For an official release, this has to be done on OS X, since the tools for creating the dmg 
 disk image file are unavailable elsewhere.
*Test the three flavours of binaries (Generic tarball, OS X disk image, Windows
 installer) for the following:
 *Rename your PL.INI file so you get the "new user experience" 
  (Or better yet, create a fresh user account to test from)
 *File size is close to the expected size (it was ~12.4 MB in 0.9.3)
 *Archive expands properly or installer works as expected
 *Try connecting to all databases that the Wabit is preconfigured for (MySQL,
  PostgreSQL, SQL Server)
 *Try adding the Oracle driver to the driver manager then connect to an Oracle
  database
 *Try creating a new database type from scratch (it could just be a new config for
  one of the existing types)
 *Ensure the online help is present
 *(When documentation exists) Scan through the PDF documentation. Ensure the pictures are included properly
  (not stretched, properly cropped)
 *Try saving and loading a Wabit file. Ensure workspace settings are persistent:
  data sources, queries and reports and so on
 *Make sure the app quits once all windows have been closed
 *For Windows only, test the uninstaller
*Commit, then tag the release in the SVN repository, if you made it all the way
 to this point without finding any new problems!
*Add the current release number without the -alpha suffix to Bugzilla, as well
 as the next release number with -alpha.

Making the new release available
*Upload generic, mac, and windows binaries to Google Code
*Upload user guide (PDF format) to Google Code
*(Introduce and...) Upload source code snapshot to Google Code
*Deprecate all Google Code files related to the previous release
*(Create and...) Upload the dist directory to the SQL Power web server on pag 
 (/tomcat/virtualhosts/download.sqlpower.ca/wabit/x.y.z/). If the dist directory
 has not yet been created the current.html page will have to be updated.
*Add/update the wabit.version.properties file on an update website domain. The Wabit
will use this to check the latest version number.

Announcing the New Release
*Post to wabit-developers mailing list
*Front page of Google Code project
*SQL Power website news item
*Freshmeat.net
*apple.com/downloads
*news wire press release if significant milestone
*Send release information to news@infoq.com and post to http://www.theserverside.com/ and http://www.dzone.com/links/index.html
